**Instructor:** Evan Ray

**Email:** eray@mtholyoke.edu

**Office:** Clapp 404C

**Office Hours:** I have regularly scheduled office hours at the times below.  These are times I guarantee I will be in my office and available, but I am also available by appointment at other times; send an email to set up a time to meet.

 * Mondays 4pm-5pm

**Evening Group Work**: We have scheduled rooms for evening group work on **Tuesdays and Thursdays** in **Clapp 416**.

**Text Books:** We will use two text books, both of which are on reserve at the library.  There are also links to free ebook versions below:

1. ["Deep Learning with Python"](http://proxy.mtholyoke.edu:2048/login?url=https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/-/9781617294433/?ar) by Fran\c{c}ois Chollet.  This book is a great practical guide to working with neural networks in Keras, but it has limited mathematical depth.

2. ["Deep Learning"](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.  This book has essentially no information about practical implementation of neural networks, but covers the mathematics in depth.

**Piazza:** We are registered on Piazza at [https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2020/stat344ne](https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2020/stat344ne).  You can ask and answer questions there, anonymously if you want, and everyone in the class will be able to see and contribute to the answers.
