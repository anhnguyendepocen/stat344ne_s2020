## Example

Suppose we're fitting a model to classify an animal as either dog, cat, or bird based on its weight:

$y^{(i)} = \begin{cases}
1 \text{ if animial $i$ is a dog} \\
2 \text{ if animial $i$ is a cat} \\
3 \text{ if animial $i$ is a bird} \\
\end{cases}$

$x^{(i)} = \text{weight of animal $i$ in pounds}$

Suppose we have fit a model and obtained the following estimates:

 * $b_1 = -4$, $w_{11} = 2.3$
 * $b_2 = 0$, $w_{21} = 2$
 * $b_3 = 10$, $w_{31} = -5$

Let's make a plot of the estimated probability of each class, as a function of the animal's weight $x$.

I have secretly defined (because I'm going to ask you to implement this function in your next homework) a function called `softmax` with the following docstring:
```
'''
Calculate softmax(z) where z is a K by M matrix

Arguments:
 - z, a K by M matrix: row j and column m of z contains b_j + w_j^T x^(i),
   the linear input to softmax for class j and observation number m

Return:
 - a K by M matrix where column m is calculated as softmax of column m of z
'''
```

#### Import libraries:

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```{python, echo = FALSE}
def softmax(z):
  t = np.exp(z)
  t_sum = np.sum(t, axis = 0)
  return(t / t_sum)
```

#### Define a grid of 101 values of x between 0 and 20 at which to compute class probabilities

```{python}
x = np.linspace(0, 20, 101).reshape((1, 101))
print("x: " + str(x))
```

\newpage

#### Parameter values

```{python}
b = np.array([[-4], [0], [10]])
print("b: " + str(b))
w_T = np.array([[2.3], [2], [-5]])
print("w_T: " + str(w_T))
```

#### Compute z and a (both are 3 by 101)

```{python}
z = b + np.dot(w_T, x)
print("z shape: " + str(z.shape))

a = softmax(z)
print("a shape: " + str(a.shape))
```

#### Make a plot

```{python, fig.height = 3}
plt.plot(x[0, :], a[0, :], c = "blue", label = "Probability of Dog")
plt.plot(x[0, :], a[1, :], c = "orange", label = "Probability of Cat")
plt.plot(x[0, :], a[2, :], c = "purple", label = "Probability of Bird")
plt.legend(loc = "upper right")
plt.show()
```
