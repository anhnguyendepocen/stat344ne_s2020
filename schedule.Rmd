    * **Reading**
        * Chollet:
            * Skim sections 1.1 -- 1.3.  This is pretty fluffy and we'll mostly either skip it or talk about it in much more depth later, but it might be nice to see now for a little context.
            * Read sections 2.1 -- 2.3 more carefully.  We will talk about this over the next day or two.
        * Goodfellow et al.:
            * Read the intro to section 5.5 (but don't worry about KL divergence), read section 5.5.1, lightly skim section 6.1, read the first 3 paragraphs of section 6.2.1.1, and skim sections 6.2.2.1, 6.2.2.2, and 6.2.2.3.  We will talk about this over the next day or two.
    * **Videos**
        * I moved the videos that were here to later days.
    * **Homework 1**
        * Written part due 5pm Wed, Jan 29
        * Coding part due 5 pm Fri, Jan 31


#### Fri, Jan 24
 * **In class**, we will work on:
    * Maximum likelihood and output activations for binary classification.  I don't have any lecture notes for this.
    * Matrix formulation of calculations for logistic regression across multiple observations.  I don't have any lecture notes for this, but it's written up in Lab 01.
    * Highlights of NumPy: https://github.com/mhc-stat344ne-s2020/Python_NumPy_foundations/blob/master/Python.ipynb
    * Lab 1: you do some calculations for logistic regression in NumPy.  You should receive an email from GitHub about this.
 * **After class**, please:
    * **Reading**
        * Continue/finish readings listed for Wed, Jan 22.
        * Take a look at the NumPy document listed above.  You can't run it directly on GitHub, but if you want you could sign into colab.research.google.com and try out some of the code there.  Also cross-reference this with the Numpy section in Chollet.
    * **Videos**:  Here are some videos of Andrew Ng talking about logistic regression and stuff we did today; you don't need to watch these, but feel free if you want a review:
        * Logistic regression set up: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjrYrynGWGA&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0&index=8)
        * Loss function just thrown out there without justification: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHEPb1JHw5o&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0&index=9)
        * Discussing set up for loss function via maximum likelihood: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_S5fnKjO-4&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0&index=24)
        * Start at thinking about \"vectorization\", i.e. writing things in terms of matrix operations: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsIrQi0fzbY&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0&index=17)
        * More on vectorization, but I think this video is more complicated than necessary and you might skip it: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYWASRauTzs&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0&index=18)
        * Vectorizing logistic regression.  Note that Andrew does this in the variant where your observations are in columns of the X matrix.  I want us to understand that you can also just take the transpose of that and get a just-as-valid way of doing the computations, just sideways.  This is worth understanding because different sources and different software packages will organize things different ways and you want mental flexibility.  We talked about this in class but I don't know of a video that explains things with the other orientation. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okpqeEUdEkY&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0&index=19)
        * [Broadcasting in NumPy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKcLaGdvabM) -- This is among my least favorite examples, apologies!
    * **Homework 1**
        * Written part due 5pm Wed, Jan 29
        * Coding part due 5 pm Fri, Jan 31

        * Some of you may find these videos helpful:
            * [Softmax regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLux1SW--oM) is another word for multinomial regression, which is the equivalent to logistic regression for multi-class classification.
    * **Homework 1**

#### Fri, Jan 31
 * **In class**, we will work on:
    * **Quiz** on logistic regression
    * Highlights from last class (see also first page of lecture notes below) ![](materials/20200131_multinomial_logistic/blackboard.jpg)
    * More concrete example of calculations for multinomial logistic regression
        * Lecture notes: [pdf](materials/20200131_multinomial_logistic/lecture_notes.pdf)
        * We also wrote out that for $m$ observations,
        \\begin{align*}
z &= \\begin{bmatrix} z^{(1)} & \\cdots & z^{(m)} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} z^{(1)}_1 & \\cdots & z^{(m)}_1 \\\\ z^{(1)}_2 & \\cdots & z^{(m)}_2 \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ z^{(1)}_K & \\cdots & z^{(m)}_K \\end{bmatrix} \\\\
&= \\begin{bmatrix} b_1 + w_1^T x^{(1)} & \\cdots & b_1 + w_1^T x^{(m)} \\\\ b_2 + w_2^T x^{(1)} & \\cdots & b_2 + w_2^T x^{(m)} \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ b_K + w_K^T x^{(1)} & \\cdots & b_K + w_K^T x^{(m)}  \\end{bmatrix} \\\\
&= \\begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ b_K \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} w_1^T \\\\ w_2^T \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ w_K^T \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x^{(1)} & x^{(2)} & \\cdots & x^{(m)} \\end{bmatrix}
\\end{align*} where the last equals sign uses Python broadcasting to pull out the vector $b$.
        * Hand out doing the calculations: [pdf](materials/20200131_multinomial_logistic/20200131_multnomial_logistic.pdf)
